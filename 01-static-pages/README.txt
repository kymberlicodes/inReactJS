# Notes from Module 1

To start the server with Live Server extension:

1. Press fn + f1
2. Type Live Server
3. Choose Open with Live Server

Otherwise you'll get a CORS policy error, because websites are run on web servers, so this is a way for you to have a quick local "web server" with the current files you're working with.
